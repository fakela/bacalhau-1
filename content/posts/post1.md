  ## **LabDAO Partnership**


  In support of the DeSci movement, the Bacalhau project is announcing our
  partnership with LabDAO, which will foster open, reproducible data processing
  for the broader DeSci community.


  LabDAO’s mission is to become an open, community-run network of wet and dry
  laboratories for life science research. As part of its mission to develop
  resources for scientists to come together and work online, LabDAO is
  interested in adopting decentralized scientific compute infrastructure for its
  scientists' work. Bacalhau will partner with LabDAO to power the data
  processing engine for their service [Lab
  Exchange](https://docs.labdao.xyz/lab-exchange/what\_is\_openlab).

  “*Our goal is to accelerate progress by making scientific tools more
  accessible - building distributed compute infrastructure is an essential
  component on the way there. We are excited to be partnering with the Bacalhau
  team to integrate this piece of the puzzle together*"&#x20;
