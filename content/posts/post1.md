headline: Bacalhau Supports Decentralized Science
excerpt: >-
  Bacalhau and Protocol Labs are proud to support the growth of the burgeoning
  Decentralized Science or “DeSci” movement. The DeSci community aims to bring
  the benefits of decentralized ownership models (often referred to as “Web3”
  technologies) to the scientific research process. Companies and DAOs
  (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) are forming in the community to
  empower new models of research ownership (IP), collaboration, and
  reproducibility.

The DeSci community aims to bring the benefits of decentralized ownership models (often referred to as “Web3” technologies) to the scientific research process. Companies and DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) are forming in the community to empower new models of research ownership (IP), collaboration, and reproducibility.&#x20;\n\n## **LabDAO Partnership**\n\n\n\n\nIn support of the DeSci movement, the Bacalhau project is announcing our partnership with LabDAO, which will foster open, reproducible data processing for the broader DeSci community.\n\n\n\n\n![LabDAO Logo](https://res.cloudinary.com/protocolai/image/upload/v1663680466/bacalhau/labdao_logo_u8xacn.png)\n\n\n\n\nLabDAO’s mission is to become an open, community-run network of wet and dry laboratories for life science research. As part of its mission to develop resources for scientists to come together and work online, LabDAO is interested in adopting decentralized scientific compute infrastructure for its scientists' work. Bacalhau will partner with LabDAO to power the data processing engine for their service [Lab Exchange](https://docs.labdao.xyz/lab-exchange/what\\_is\\_openlab).\n\n\n\n\n“*Our goal is to accelerate progress by making scientific tools more accessible - building distributed compute infrastructure is an essential component on the way there. We are excited to be partnering with the Bacalhau team to integrate this piece of the puzzle together*\"&#x20;\n\n\\- Niklas Rindtorff, LabDAO Founder & Core\n\n\n\n\n## **Gitcoin Grants Round 15**\n\nOur parent organization, Protocol Labs, is helping to fund the recent Gitcoin Grants Round 15 included a specific section for supporting [Decentralized Science](https://gitcoin.co/grants/explorer/?page=3\\&limit=12\\&me=false\\&sort\\_option=weighted\\_shuffle\\&collection\\_id=false\\&network=mainnet\\&state=active\\&profile=false\\&round\\_num=15\\&customer\\_name=DeSci\\&sub\\_round\\_slug=gr15-desci\\&collections\\_page=1\\&grant\\_regions=\\&grant\\_types=\\&grant\\_tags=\\&tenants=\\&idle=true\\&featured=true\\&round\\_type=false\\&tab=grants). Each Gitcoin grants program runs for 15 days and allows donors to support a wide variety of projects via quadratic voting.\_\n\n\n\n\nThe Bacalhau project supports DeSci projects of all sizes and we are excited to see the advancements resulting from this funding round.\n\n\n"
